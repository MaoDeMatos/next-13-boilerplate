# ⚡Next.js boilerplate

⚡A simple [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) v13 boilerplate with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) & [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/) to start building quickly.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18.14.2+

## Getting Started

Run the development server locally:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## CLI

- `yarn dev` to start the development server
- `yarn build` for a prerendered production build
- `yarn start` to preview locally the production build
- `yarn lint` & `yarn format:tidy` to lint and format your code

To have control when upgrading dependencies, you'll need to use `yarn upgrade-interactive`, installed as a plugin.
